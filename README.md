This is a supplemental vignette for Oyafuso et al. (In Review) entitled, "XXX" . This method is also used in Oyafuso et al. (2019). Code and techniques from other workers are used in this script. Please refer to Beyer et al. (2016) for the linearization of the compactness term used in their paper to linearize the boundary length term in the Marxan objective function. Also see M. Strimas-Mackey's article entitled, "Field Guide to ILP Solvers in R for Conservation Prioritization," on his personal website for a survey of open-source solving methods in R.
